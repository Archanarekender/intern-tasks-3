## 8. Technical Architecture

### How Daily Quote Selection Works

**Deterministic Daily Quote:**
The app uses a mathematical approach to ensure all users see the same quote on the same day[117]:

1. **Date to Number Conversion**: 
   - Calculate milliseconds since epoch: `Date.now()`
   - Divide by milliseconds in a day: `86400000`
   - Floor the result to get day number: `Math.floor(Date.now() / 86400000)`

2. **Quote Selection**:
   - Use day number as index in quotes array
   - Modulo operation handles array boundaries: `dayNumber % quotesArray.length`
   - This ensures different quote each day
   - Same quote for all users on same day

3. **Example**:
   - Day 1: Quote index 0
   - Day 2: Quote index 1
   - Day 365: Quote index 364 (cycles through year)
   - Same logic repeats: Day 366 loops back to index 0

### Data Storage

**In-Memory Architecture:**
- 250+ quotes stored in JavaScript array
- Each quote contains: id, text, author, category, tags
- Favorites stored separately (array of favorite IDs)

**LocalStorage Implementation:**
```javascript
// Saving favorites
localStorage.setItem('favorites', JSON.stringify(favoriteIds));

// Retrieving favorites
const favorites = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('favorites')) || [];

// Adding to favorites
if (!favorites.includes(quoteId)) {
  favorites.push(quoteId);
  localStorage.setItem('favorites', JSON.stringify(favorites));
}
```

**Session Persistence:**
- Favorites persist across page refreshes
- Data remains until manually cleared
- Each user's favorites are independent
- No server synchronization required

### Sharing Implementation

**URL Encoding:**
- Quote text encoded using `encodeURIComponent()`
- Handles special characters and spaces
- Formats: `"Quote text" - Author Name`

**Share URL Formats**[100][106][120]:
```
Twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=ENCODED_TEXT
WhatsApp: https://wa.me/?text=ENCODED_TEXT
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL
Email: mailto:?subject=SUBJECT&body=ENCODED_BODY
```

**Clipboard API:**
```javascript
navigator.clipboard.writeText(quoteText + " - " + author)
  .then(() => console.log('Copied!'))
  .catch(() => console.log('Copy failed'));
```
